# Need to add the rest of the code from Mar 25 in the morning

### Saving and loading models
 
Models can be saved by calling the `save` method and be loaded using the `SBloadModel` function.
```{r,  eval=TRUE}
model$save("/tmp/myModel.Rdata")
model2 = SBloadModel("/tmp/myModel.Rdata")
eval2 = model2$evaluate()
```
