1	I thought played extremely well yesterday
1	They want him so bad
1	Not a bad draw for them
-1	the center of midfield wasn't great
-1	The number of passes made which reached a player tonight Embarrassing
-1	is a dirty Scouse bastard Can we look at that instead of wanking on about the penalty
-1	you dirty little man
-1	kicks the shit out of
-1	could indecently assault an elderly lady at old trafford and still nothing will be made of it
-1	Jammy bastards talk about luck deserting again eh The ref biased a dirty bastard too
-1	is a scouse cheating twat in every possible way
-1	How has  not been sent off  The ball was long gone
-1	How is even still on the field for  He's been utter shite Can only seem to pass to a opposing player
-1	Is really a footballer
-1	is a waste period
-1	produce countless unforced errors
-1	you bellend Offside
-1	Finishing needs work Especially
-1	bad performance in this first half
-1	Did nothing except scoring
-1	I think has issues probably with his girlfriend or something He lacks concentration on the pitch Awful performance today
-1	Very strange performance from The things he was bad at passing control he's done well His best asset (finishing) atrocious
-1	all wasteful
-1	Poor performance were all underwhelming for most of the game Esp
-1	is having a fucking nightmare all he needs is a red card to top off his performance
-1	blatantly kicked
-1	Poor performance from united miss big time Lacking a leader
-1	overall were poor can't see them going far on that performance badly missed
-1	bad performance from united in 1st half I hope be better in 2nd half what happened
-1	is such a stupid ass why not play earlier & take out He can even 10 men  IS A FOOL
-1	Crazy Penalty Awarded
-1	He dived
-1	Referee in the game had an absolute mare
-1	He was horrible
-1	He's doubtful
-1	Been revealed that he is Doubtful For Saturday
-1	They have a lot of average players
-1	Far too much dead wood
-1	We have a predictable midfield
-1	We don't use the ball both well enough or quick enough
-1	I think he is one who is not good enough
-1	he's a rare breed of useless
-1	It's sad
-1	It's sad but I can't see any of the young players from today who will make it
-1	The problem is we picked so many average players to start today
-1	His flicks and passes were useless
-1	It was a fairly unexciting debut
-1	Bit disappointed with him tonight if I'm honest
-1	I think he was given shit instructions
-1	He is shit
-1	It was one of those poor overall team performances
-1	His inability
-1	That is ludicrous
-1	didn't have a good game
-1	He didn't do what he was told
-1	poor game from him too much pressure on the lad to perform not ready
-1	we have too many average midfielders
-1	agree we flopped at Euro's but players must shoulder some blame amongst others were so bad was let down
-1	there wasn't a leader
-1	I disagree He is not a top player
-1	Too many players aren't good enough
-1	that was slightly annoying about tonight
-1	it doesn't make any sense
-1	Unfortunately
-1	He struggles to beat his man
-1	His crossing of late has been dreadful as well
-1	Tonight's showing was abysmal
-1	if it is lack of motivation
-1	we lack creativity in the middle
-1	not really that good enough
-1	which is a shame
-1	has impacted massively on our peformances
-1	This is a disappointing time for us
-1	Such a lack of determination
-1	He did everything wrong today
-1	You taking the piss or are you actually that simple
-1	Fuck off you arrogant prick
-1	but he was quite frankly shit
-1	his final ball at times was very poor
-1	He must take a bit of a blame
-1	Two poor games in a row
-1	He was poor hasn't delivered in a few months now
-1	Seemed to lack the intensity
-1	that miss is awful
-1	he was frustrating
-1	I really don't like these slumps of form
-1	there is a lot of inexperience of our right-backs
-1	He is much slower
-1	He has lost much pace
-1	his pace is gone
-1	Horrible injury
-1	we have had so many injuries
-1	that injury was horrible
-1	abysmal injury record
-1	pretty dull game
-1	I am so bored
-1	this game is so boring
-1	we've played some poor football
-1	a very stupid thing to do
-1	lacked creativity
-1	He went through the injuries
-1	he isn't sharp enough
-1	missed almost an entire season with a serious long-term illness
-1	Part of the problem
-1	He was a coward
-1	The assistant's in the game are shit
-1	Basically the ref bottled it today
-1	unable to play
-1	Many of us lack a proper understanding of football
-1	clouded some of our judgement
-1	We do have a few absolute ballbags in our ranks
-1	The level of negativity here has been astounding
-1	Spoilt beyond belief
-1	doom and gloom feckers after a couple of shitty results
-1	a few are spoilt by success
-1	fat Geordie bastard
-1	fans who booed their team off
-1	little enjoyment from the game
-1	we have a few spoilt pricks
-1	The atmosphere is appalling sometimes
-1	Definitely a lot of spoiled twats on here
-1	My main issue is with arrogant spoilt ungrateful fans
-1	playing shite
-1	they are as spoilt as us
-1	continuously booed their team off
-1	for falling short
-1	My gripe was with spoilt and unrealistic people
-1	who leave before the end are the worst
-1	talking bollocks as usual
-1	A bit of knee jerking going on
-1	It's sort of ruining it for me
-1	are generally deluded to fuck
-1	I was disappointed and frustrated too
-1	You pathetic sad twat
-1	A lot of us are complaining
-1	We have as big a percentage of tossers
-1	was a bit sloppy
-1	Below par
-1	for this negativity but fuck it
-1	The negativity here is stupid and retarded granted it was a poor performance
-1	That was the worst performance result in the
-1	probably even worse
-1	His form this season has been fairly worrying
-1	I was angry
-1	He was dire as well
-1	he is fucking apologising
-1	completely unbalanced side
-1	was really disappointing
-1	that was dire
-1	seem to have a slump
-1	it's annoying to lose
-1	the doom merchants are out in force
-1	absolute abortion of a team
-1	He is shit
-1	Awful month
-1	Awful week

-1	It genuinely bemuses me
-1	this shit will continue
-1	The fuckers should be forced
