####Overview####



Goal: Predict Titanic Passenger Survival
<br>
This example demonstrates how to perform a simple classification.
We will use data from the famous Kaggle competition to predict whether a passenger will survive.

<br>
<br>

####Training data####

We can retrieve the titanic train data by calling `data = getData("titanic_train")`. The column `survived` represents whether a Titanic passenger survived.
<br>
To make the problem slightly more difficult we will remove the `sex` and `age` columns using the `excludeCols` function.

```{r basic_classification_2, results='asis'}
data = getData("titanic_train")
data = excludeCols(data, c("sex", "age"))
#View(data) # in order to view the data in an RStudio tab
print(xtable(data[1:5,]), type='html', comment=F)
```
<br>
<br>

####Pipeline####

Feature search and model building are performed via the `learn` function. 
<br>

Before we can start learning we will need to log in.
```{r basic_classification_3_0, eval=FALSE}
login(username = "user@example.com", password = "12345", domain="http://<ip>")
```	

```{r basic_classification_3, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
titanicSurvivedModel = learn(
	projectName = "titanic_survived",
	trainData = data,
	target = "survived"    
)
```
<br>

####Top features####

On the Titanic most children and women were rescued first, hence had higher survival rates.
The first feature that was generated, identifies the column `name` as PersonName and effectively captures the gender information conveyed in this column.

Here are the top 3 features (each contains a lift signal pointing to which class each feature suggests). We can get them by calling the `features()` method of the Session object which will return them as a data frame.

```{r basic_classification_4, eval=TRUE, results='asis', cache=TRUE}
print(xtable(titanicSurvivedModel$features()[1:3,c("feature", "Lift.0", "Lift.1")]), type='html', comment=F)
```
<br>

To view an html reports with all the information on the features and the model.
```{r basic_classification_5, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#webView
titanicSurvivedModel$webView()

#show train features
titanicSurvivedModel$showFeaturesTrain()

#show test features
titanicSurvivedModel$showFeaturesTest()

#show how the test features are compared to the train features
titanicSurvivedModel$showFeatureStability()
```

####Evaluation####

The `evaluate` method returns the model evaluation statistics
```{r basic_classification_7, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
evaluation = titanicSurvivedModel$evaluate()
```
